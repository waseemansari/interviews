Microservices is an architectural style where an application is structured as a collection of small, independent services that communicate via APIs. Each service focuses on a specific function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### **Key Features of Microservices:**
- **Independence:** Each service runs independently and can be updated without affecting others.
- **Scalability:** Services can be scaled individually based on demand.
- **Decentralized Data Management:** Each service can have its own database.
- **Technology Agnostic:** Different services can be built with different programming languages and frameworks.
- **Fault Isolation:** If one service fails, it doesnâ€™t bring down the whole application.

### **Common Technologies for Microservices:**
- **Languages:** Node.js, Python, Java, Go, .NET
- **Communication:** REST, gRPC, GraphQL, Message Queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes
- **API Gateway:** Kong, Nginx, AWS API Gateway
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
